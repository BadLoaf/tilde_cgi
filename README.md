# Troubadour's webpage

My small webpage hosted on tilde.club.

A cgi implemented using perl.

### Workflow

All html changes are made to the html file.
All serverside logic changes are made to the perl files.
The helper scripts automate adding the html to the cgi file.

`./write` to apply changes in the .html file
`./upload` write + upload the files to the server
